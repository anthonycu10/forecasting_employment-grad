# Employment Outcomes for College Graduates  
### A Time Series Analysis  

## Abstract  
This project analyzes the total employment population of individuals with a bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher to assess workforce trends and forecast employment. Using historical data from January 1992 to December 2018, multiple time series models, including SAR, ARIMA, and SARIMA, are evaluated. The optimal model is selected based on AICc scores and diagnostic checking.  

The **SARIMA(4,1,0)√ó(5,1,0)‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ** model demonstrates the best fit and is used to forecast total employment populations for 2019. The findings provide insights into labor market trends for individuals with a college degree, highlighting the impact of higher education on employment. This project also demonstrates the effectiveness of time series modeling in employment forecasting.
